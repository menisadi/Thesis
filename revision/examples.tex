\paragraph{VC dimension}

To illustrate this concept intuitively, consider the simple function class of one-dimensional intervals on the real line. 
In this case, the VC dimension can be easily grasped. 
Let $\mathcal{H}$ be the set of all intervals of the form $[a, b]$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. An interval classifier labels by $1$ any point which lays inside the interval and $0$ for any other point.
It is clear that if we take two distinct points $x_1$ and $x_2$ in the real line such that, w.l.o.g, $x_1 < x_2$, we can find intervals in $\mathcal{H}$ that can shatter them. spesifically: 
\begin{intemize}
  \item The interval $[x_1-2,x_1-1]$ labels the pair by $(0,0)$.
  \item The interval $[x_1-1,x_1]$ labels the pair by $(0,1)$.
  \item The interval $[x_2+1,x_2+2]$ labels the pair by $(1,1)$.
  \item The interval $[x_2,x_2+1]$ labels the pair by $(1,0)$.
\end{itemize}
In other words the pair $x_1$ and $x_2$ can be labeled by any possible sequence of binary sequence of the same length. 
But, given a triplet $x_1 < x_2 < x_3$ there is not interval in $\mathcal{H}$ that can label them $(1,0,1)$.
As the size of the smallest set that can be shattered by $\mathcal{H}$ is $2$, the VC dimension of $\mathcal{H}$ is $2$.
