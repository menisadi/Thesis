\paragraph{MedBoost}
Intuitively, the MedBoost algorithm uses the weak learner in order iteratively produce weak hypotheses. It maintains a distribution on the initial sample which adaptivly gives more wieght to hard data points, enabeling it to focus on those problematic points. Finally it assigins weight to each learner according to its preformence. We can then use the series of learners and weights in order to construct a single strong hypothesis by taking the weighted median or the weighted quantile.
