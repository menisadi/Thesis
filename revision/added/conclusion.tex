\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chp:conclusion}
In this thesis, we have delved into the intricate interplay between theoretical machine learning, differential privacy, and compression. Throughout our investigation, we have explored the conceptual and quantitative connections between these three domains, offering novel insights and solutions to fundamental challenges in the realm of data-driven problems. Our exploration has led us to uncover new perspectives on privacy-preserving algorithms, compression schemes, and the symbiotic relationship between learning and compression.

\section{Summary of Contributions}
\label{sec:conclusion:contributions}
Our research has spanned across multiple aspects, with each component contributing to our broader understanding of the intricate connections between differential privacy, compression, and machine learning.

We initiated our inquiry by examining the intertwinement of machine learning and compression, seeking to understand the qualitative and quantitative connections between these domains. Our work illuminated the equivalence between learning and compression in certain settings, providing another bridge between the realms of compression schemes and algorithmic learning. We extended this relationship to encompass regression problems, presenting a pioneering compressed regression result that uses minimal sample size while maintaining efficint running-time. This foundational contribution lays the groundwork for future developments in efficient, information-preserving data analysis.

Diving into the realm of privacy, we addressed the fundamental question of how much data is necessary to learn while ensuring privacy remains uncompromised. We tackled the problem of privatly learning axis-aligned rectangles, a case which serves as a basic building block for a range of complex algorithms. The concept of sample complexity emerged as a pivotal point of investigation. Through innovative algorithmic design, we achieved an almost optimal trade-off, minimizing sample complexity. This achievement not only offers practical benefits in privacy-aware learning but also contributes to the broader discourse on the balance between learning efficiency and privacy guarantees.

Our exploration further led us to challenge the traditional definition of learning, advocating for a more flexible paradigm termed "Universal Learning." By questioning the pessimistic worst-case assumptions, we provided insights into aligning theoretical models with real-world data properties. This departure from the conventional approach bears the potential to bridge the gap between theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning, particularly under privacy constraints.

In the realm of adaptive data analysis, we navigated the complex landscape of inquiries emerging from evolving data accumulation processes. Bridging ideas from privacy and compression, we tackled the challenge of extending adaptive tools to encompass correlated examples. Our results showcased the feasibility of adapting privacy-based and compression-based algorithms to these intricate scenarios, thereby expanding the toolbox for reliable data analysis in adaptive settings.

\srction{Implications and Future Research}
\label{sec:conclusion:future}

The contributions of this thesis pave the way for several exciting avenues of future research.

Firstly, the relationship between learning and compression, while extensively explored, still harbors uncharted territories. Investigating the precise limits of this connection is a fundumental problem whcih alinges with some long standing problems in the field. Namely, finding the optimal compression size for regressnio prpblems extends the known open question regarding the possibility of linear relation between compression size and the sample complexity of learning. One possible path might include extending and analyzing some spesific well-studies classes such as \emph{Maximal Classes} nd \emph{Duddly Classes}.

The exploration of sample complexity within a privacy-preserving context remains a fertile ground for further investigation. Investigating the trade-offs between privacy requirements and learning efficiency across a wider array of learning tasks could lead to more comprehensive and nuanced results, enabling practitioners to strike a fine balance between utility and privacy. On the particular scope of this thesis, a recent work emerged to definitively address the challenge of privately learning axis-aligned rectangles. This work introduced an optimal algorithm for the problem, culminating in a comprehensive solution that builds upon the foundation laid by our exploration.

The proposition of Universal Learning as a more flexible paradigm has significant implications for bridging the gap between theory and practice. Extending this approach to various machine learning paradigms and addressing its applicability in real-world scenarios could contribute to the development of more adaptive and resilient learning algorithms. Moreover, quantifying the precise sample complexity for fundumental problems and algorithms under this framework could provide a more nuanced understanding of the trade-offs between privacy and learning efficiency.

Lastly, adaptive data analysis, as one of the novel challenges posed in this thesis, holds untapped potential for future exploration. Investigating more complex adaptive scenarios and devising mechanisms to integrate privacy and compression in such settings can foster the development of robust and practical data analysis tools. Concurrently with our theoretical research, a paramount objective is the creation of effective algorithmic implementations in the realm of adaptive data analysis. Such implementations are pivotal in rendering these algorithms accessible to researchers and statisticians. Their availability could serve to minimize errors resulting from the improper utilization of conventional tools, and may help research areas where collecting information is a difficult and expensive job.
