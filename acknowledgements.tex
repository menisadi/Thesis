    Finally, I would like to dedicate this thesis to my grandfathers, Shmuel (Smil) Sadigurschi and Simpson Shimon Kalmus, 
    who sacrificed a lot for their family. 
    Your ability to see the hidden beauty in the world and to rejoice in it has always been an inspiration to me. 
    Guardarei voçês na minha memória para sempre.
